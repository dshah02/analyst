[Pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-LYzf7MsY4tNXtJaHVgQIZeWjZoiEtR8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114094351316596866174&rtpof=true&sd=true)

*Multi-source data analysis without the risk of hallucinations.*

> An intelligent, verifiable AI agent that turns messy, multi-source macro & CRM data into trustworthy, reproducible insights—using natural-language questions and code-backed answers.

## Overview

**The Verifiable Analyst** transforms traditional CRM and macro-economic data into an intelligent conversational analytics platform. Ask a question in plain English; get an answer that’s backed by executable code, complete methodology, and citations you can audit.

**Key outcomes**

* Faster time-to-insight (minutes, not days)
* End-to-end automation from data discovery to synthesized intelligence
* Confidence by design: every step is transparent and reproducible

> Built for the Dedalus AI Agents Hackathon (Eragon Track).

## Why It Matters

Organizations spend heavily on slow, manual analysis:

* Financial analyst compensation and subscriptions add up
* Analysis turnaround is **days to weeks**
* Results can be opaque or non-reproducible

*The Verifiable Analyst* collapses this workflow into a single, auditable loop.

## What It Does

* **Automated Dataset Discovery**
  Finds and accesses relevant macro and CRM datasets across authoritative sources.

* **Dynamic Analysis Tool Generation**
  Produces custom analytical scripts/models tailored to the question at hand.

* **Comprehensive Intelligence Synthesis**
  Delivers data-driven insights with rigorous method, code, and citations.

* **Verifiable Results**
  Every insight ships with the code and steps to reproduce it.

**Representative use cases**

* **Customer Behavior Analysis**
  “Which customer segments increased spending during the last quarter?”

* **Market Trend Identification**
  “How are inflation trends affecting our customer retention rates?”

* **Revenue Attribution**
  “What macro factors contributed most to our Q3 revenue growth?”

* **Predictive Customer Insights**
  “Which customers are most at risk if interest rates rise by 2%?”

## How It Works

1. **Query Interpretation** – NLP parses questions about economics, markets, or financial trends.
2. **Data Source Identification** – Agents locate and integrate the most relevant macro datasets.
3. **Tool Generation** – The system creates bespoke analysis scripts/models for the question.
4. **Analysis Execution** – Code runs, results are computed, and signals are synthesized.
5. **Intelligence Delivery** – Outputs include results, code, methodology, and citations.

**Architecture**

* **Agent System:** Dedalus SDK
* **Core AI:** LLMs with tool-use capabilities
* **Data Integration:** Multi-source dataset discovery & access
* **Analysis Engine:** Dynamic tool generation & execution
* **Interface:** Natural-language query understanding

## Principles: Verifiability & Reproducibility

* **No blind text** – Every result is derived from executable code.
* **Auditability** – Code and data sources are visible end-to-end.
* **Reproducibility** – Anyone can re-run and validate the analysis steps.
* **Lean-inspired** – Each step implies the next, minimizing waste and ambiguity.

## Example Questions

* *Customer behavior:* “Show cohort-level spend changes by segment for Q/Q and Y/Y.”
* *Macro sensitivity:* “Estimate churn risk if CPI rises 1% and rates +200 bps.”
* *Attribution:* “Attribute Q3 revenue delta across macro factors (CPI, rates,
